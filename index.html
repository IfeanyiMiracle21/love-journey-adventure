            "It all started back in 100 Level at AAUA. I was known as the king of Accounting, confident, ambitious, maybe a little too proud. She, the radiant queen of Guidance and Counselling, J&C for short, was elegant, smart, and effortlessly beautiful. We both found ourselves in a group chat for the FACE of AAUA contestants. Fate had just opened the first page of our story.",
            "In the group, we introduced ourselves—names, departments, pictures. Then it was her turn. She shared her name, J&C, and that picture. My heart paused. I whispered, ‘Damn… who is this girl?’ Her smile was poetry, her eyes galaxies I wanted to explore. I couldn’t resist and slid into her DMs. No reply. I tried again—silence. But I felt she was meant to be mine.",
            "After many tries, she finally responded briefly—‘I’m Anisha.’ A month of silence followed until her quirky WhatsApp status gave me a chance. I replied playfully, sincerely, and it worked. We started chatting. She asked where I was from. ‘Anambra,’ I said. She smiled, ‘You’re Igbo, right?’ Her warmth drew me in.",
            "We met in person soon after. I trusted her instantly, handing her my phone during an exam—no password hidden. She collected my tally and made funny videos. When I saw them, I laughed, feeling love stir. That day, she wasn’t just a pretty face—she felt like home.",
            "School vacated, and we returned to our cities. Chats turned into hours-long calls, filled with laughter, jokes, and her voice saying my name like music. I fell deeply, but when I confessed, she friend-zoned me, mentioning another guy. It hurt, so I pulled back to protect my heart.",
            "She noticed my distance and called, upset I’d changed. That meant she cared. When school resumed, she invited me over, lifted me like a treasure, and insisted I eat. I gave in, my heart full. The next day, she visited me too.",
            "During one visit, I asked if she was still a virgin—too personal, too soon. She was angry, and I apologized, not wanting to cause her any further hurt. Later, with more trust, I asked again. She opened up, and that night, we kissed—soft, then deep, like a love song.",
            "Our kiss led to a night of love, a melody that slowed the world. The next morning, sunlight poured like honey as I looked into her eyes and asked, ‘Will you be my girlfriend?’ She said yes, and our hearts truly began their dance.",
            "A month as a couple brought a cozy movie night. We cuddled, laughed, and grew closer, our story weaving tighter with every moment.",
            "Now, as National Girlfriend Day nears, our love deepens. This journey from a group chat to a lifetime feels like destiny."
