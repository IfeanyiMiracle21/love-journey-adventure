            "It all started back in 100 Level. I was known as the king of Accounting, with confidence, presence, and maybe a little too much pride. She was the shining queen of Guidance and Counselling, G&C for short, poised, beautiful, with a quiet grace that stopped me in my tracks. We were both added to a group chat for FACE of AAUA contestants a moment fate whispered, 'Watch closely. Something beautiful is about to begin.'",
            "In the group, we introduced ourselves names, departments, pictures. I wasn’t paying attention until her turn. Her name. Her department. And then… the picture. I stopped breathing for a second. ‘Damn… who is this girl?’ I said to myself. It wasn’t just her beauty, it was her aura, her confidence, her smile. I slid into her DMs.",
            "No reply. I tried again nothing. But I kept trying gently, respectfully. Weeks later, she replied with one word: ‘Aneesha.’ It felt like sunlight breaking through clouds. Then, her WhatsApp status gave me a chance. I responded cleverly, playfully, genuinely, unlocking our chats. She asked where I was from ‘Anambra,’ I said. She smiled, ‘I knew you were Igbo.’",
            "We met in person soon after. I trusted her instantly, giving her my phone password during exams. She collected my tally and recorded silly videos. When I saw them, I laughed like a boy in love. That day, something shifted she wasn’t just a pretty face; she felt like home.",
            "School vacated, and we went home. Chats turned to long calls three, four hours of dreams, fears, and laughter. She felt like a piece of my soul I didn’t know I missed. I confessed I liked her, but she said we were just friends, even mentioning another guy. It hurt, so I pulled back.",
            "She noticed my distance and asked what changed. That showed she cared. When school resumed, she invited me over, offered food, and lifted me off the ground. I laughed, my heart full. The next day, she visited me.",
            "I asked a personal question too soon if she was a virgin. She was hurt, and I apologized. Days later, she returned, softer. She opened up, and that night, we shared our first kiss gentle, tender, meaningful leading to love, deep and unspoken.",
            "The next morning, with sunlight like honey, I asked, ‘Will you be my girlfriend?’ She said yes. Our love story began, but it wasn’t perfect. Storms, fights, breakups, and tears tested us.",
            "Through it all, we chose each other every time. Not a fairytale, but a fight persistence, growth, forgiveness. By September, it’ll be two years of laughter, kisses, video calls, and holding hands through life’s challenges.",
            "I look at her today and think, ‘I was right from the start.’ She wasn’t just a girl in a group chat—she was the one. I’ll choose her tomorrow, and every day after. This is what love looks like."
